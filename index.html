        <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hey there! I'm Jacob Ross, a student at the Art Institute of Portland studying web development and design. I've been playing with web technologies for the past four years and cartooning ever since I could hold a pencil. I'm really interested in what the web industry has to offer. There are so many awesome people making incredible products in this industry and I want to be one of those people. I am really excited about making ridiculously fun and awesome games, sites, apps, and cartoons! My dream is to be able to develop games and do my own artwork for them. </p>

          <p>Let's do this! :D</p>
